### Why Decorator? 
1. Flexibility: You can add or remove features (sound, vibration, LED) without changing the basic notification code
2. Single Responsibility: Each decorator handles one specific feature
3. Open/Closed Principle: You can add new behaviors without modifying existing code
4. Runtime Configuration: You can combine decorators differently based on user preferences or conditions
